# Beoplay Remote for macOS

This is an unofficial app to remote control network enabled [Bang & Olufsen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/) loudspeakers from macOS.

The menu bar app has basic support for play/pause and forward/backward. The volume level can be adjusted and works well with volume adjustments made directly on the loudspeakers, through the original B&O iOS app, Spotify and Deezer. Speakers are automatically discovered via Bonjour. TuneIn favorite radio stations are fetched from the device and can be changed via [hotkeys](Configuration.md#hotkeys--keyboard-shortcuts).



Apple keyboards features <kbd>volume-down</kbd> and <kbd>volume-up</kbd> keys to control the volume of the local speakers. When the same physical keys function as <kbd>F11</kbd> and <kbd>F12</kbd> keys they can control the volume of the remote speakers via this application.

| Local speakers           | Remote speakers                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>volume-down</kbd>   | <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>volume-down</kbd> |
| <kbd>volume-up</kbd>     | <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>volume-up</kbd>   |
